Traffic Management System

A Python-based simulation project designed to manage vehicle traffic on multiple roads using logic-based control. 
The system mimics real-world traffic by assigning green signals to the busiest roads and controlling vehicle flow round-by-round.

 Features

- Simulates four roads: North, East, South, and West
- Vehicles arrive randomly on different roads
- Detects the road with the most traffic and gives it a green signal
- Clears a limited number of vehicles per round (adjustable)
- Prints real-time updates in the console for demonstration

- Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Random module for simulating vehicle arrival
- Time module for delay between rounds
